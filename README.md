# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm Implementation from Scratch

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch without using the scikit-learn library. The implementation supports multiple distance metrics including Euclidean, Manhattan, and Supremum.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- math (Python Library)
  
## Class Implementation

The KNN class implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It supports three distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Supremum.

## Accuracy Calculation Function

The calculate_accuracy function computes the accuracy of the KNN classifier by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels of the test data.

## Key Features and Functionalities
- Data Retrieval: Load and preprocess the dataset for training and testing.
- Distance Metrics: Support for Euclidean, Manhattan, and Supremum distances.
- Prediction: Predict the class of a new data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.
- Accuracy Calculation: Evaluate the performance of the KNN classifier using test data.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Implementation of the KNN algorithm from scratch.
- Understanding of various distance metrics and their applications.
- Ability to predict and evaluate the performance of the model.
